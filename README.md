# My first website


Since I have to save myself due to the requirement of our college. I have to deal with the front-end knowledge to help our team to finish our project.So I have to learning HTMl,CSS,JavaScript,etc.And I decide to set up my own blog with these knowledge.As a beginer,there must be a lot of problems and difficulties.So,if you are going to help.It is ok and nice.Thanks for reading this.
